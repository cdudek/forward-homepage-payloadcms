### 1. What makes your products different from other market intelligence tools?

We focus on delivering decision-ready insights—not another dashboard to manage. Our tools integrate with the systems your team already uses. Whether you're working with Tableau, Looker, Cliqmagic, HubSpot, or Salesforce, insights become part of your daily workflows—not something separate from them.

No. We integrate directly into your existing systems—specifically Salesforce and HubSpot. You don't need to manage another dashboard or platform.
